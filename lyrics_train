tina nolan had a man with a good place for siftin he invited me diggin so i picked up my screen and a shovel to dig and a jar of shine he traded me fair for a bottle of wine his brothers barnes mountain wine we trudged through the snow straight up the hillside took a ridge for a while then we slowly went down to an overhang  hid from the ridgeline we bent o'er our handles and we bit in the ground the dark and bloody ground was a bitch to break ground but the wine kept us goin' the moonshine was flowin' and keepin' us warm 'cause you cant hold a girl with a fistful of shovel got to find your fire in the company of corn we dug for a while then it all turned to ashes found a bunch of broke flint and a few bits of bone then i heard jesse yell o'er the pile he was sifting shook the hills like the angels were callin us home jesse zachary come home it was banded as hell it was fluted and clovis it was hot as the pistol i kept on my side i was fiending so fierce i was broke ass and busted i pulled out my pistol and i took jesses life a clovis like that is a hard point to find makes pills swift to come by with a good chunk of change left over for burn on whatever meanness whatever woman is comin' my way darlin' come my way i sit in this cell for the banded clovis i stole off of nolan when i killed'm that day i reckon the chase of the pills and the powder corn liquor and women are the culprits to blame,1
